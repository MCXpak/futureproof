Hello, My name is Mourad! 

Growing up, technology has inevitably been a big part of my life. Specifically, video games and other forms of media have 
provided me countless hours of entertainment and some of my most cherished memories. The enjoyment that technology has enabled is one of the reasons why I love it so much. 

Being naturally curious and creative during my younger years, I played around with modifying video games which led me to discover programming. 
Overwhelmed by the complexities of programming, I encountered Python which became my first programming language where computer science in general started becoming a part of my life.

Seeing how it's impacted my life and others around me, I developed a desire to create technologies that can help and/or entertain others and I want to be part of a team and organisation
that is creating that impact.

My curiosity and natural attraction to problem solving led me to expand my horizons in engineering and technology which led me to embark on a Robotics Engineering degree.
Upon the complection of my degree and realising how much I enjoyed my programming modules the most, I knew I wanted to have a career more specificially around technology and software.
This led me to futureproof where I was attracted towards the course content and technolgies that interests me, which upon completion will allow a succesful start to my career in the industry.

My career ambitions include making an impact and producing great products, but I also want to attain higher positions and lead teams in the future, where I believe my impact would be most valuable.

Thank you for taking the time to view this video, and I hope you've learnt something about me.
