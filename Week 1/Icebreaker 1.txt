What is tech? What is tech to you?
 

Tech is a lifestyle. A bunch of 1s and 0s. Tech is a tool to help us in our everyday lifes. We think "tech" is anything that can compute. 
The ultimate goal is to allow us to efficiently do things and automate things.

Who has worked in tech?

Vanessa was a graduate consultant before futureproof at brightgen. Examples of positions project manager, ui/ux design, tester. 

What positions do you consider important in a tech team.
Each role is as important as each other but if we had to pick.
1. Testing (bad code is worse than no code)
2. Front End. If it looks nice you can get away with it.
3. Back end. It needs to work, not just look nice. 
4. Projet Manager. Gets the team talking to each other. But a good team will can work well without good management.
