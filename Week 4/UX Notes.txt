Steps of UX deisgn process

1. Product definiton
2. Research
3. Analysis
4. Deisgn
5. Validation

Product Definition
- Define what the product is, done before anything is created
- Before you build your product, it's important to fully understand the reason for being
	- Stakeholder interviews to gather insights and goals
	- Concept sketchin - early and simple mockups

UX Research
Market research - to understand industry standards and look at other products to know what's out there, aka Competitive Research
User-research - in-depth interviews

Analysis
Move from "what" users think or want to "why" they think or want it
This phase can include
	User personas: ficitonal characters that represent the differen user types for your product
	User stories: Tool that helps designer understand a product or service from the user's point of view
	Storyboarding: story of a user interacting with the product
	
Design
This phase includes
Sketching: done on a piece of paper with a pen helps visualise a broad range of designer
Wireframing: backbone of a product
	Low-fidelity wireframes: structure of a page but on a digital tool (e.g. Figma)
	High-fidelity wireframes: go into colours, typography, images
Prototyping: 
	Interactions between pages of a prodcut - arrows that show the flow of your UX
	Design specifications and systems: building the isual design assets, components and patterns required for developers to turn prototype into a working product
	

Validation
	Testing with actual users
	
UX vs UI
UX - creating a simple, useful and delightful experience of the app
UI - look and feel of the app


Accessibillity
	Allows users of all abilities to understand, use and enjoy the web

WCAG Web Content Accessibillity Guidelines
	Percievable - make sure users can recognise and use your service with the senses that are available to them
	operable: make sure users can find and use your content, regardless of how they choose to access it
	Robust: make sure your content can be interpret reliably by a wide variety of user groups

Research
User research - a way to understand usejr;s needs, behaviours, expoerience and motivations through different techniques - interviews, observations, surveys
Can be done in all stages of your product design process

Why it's important
- User-centered design and research

Different reserach methods
- Qualitiative
	User interviews - aksing users about their experience with a product
	Contextual inquiry - observing how users interact with a product
	Guerilla testing - gathering user feedback by taking a prototype into a public place like a cafe and asking people for their thoughts
	Usability testing - testing if a oridyct by people who represent the target audience - moderating and unmoderated
	Focus groups - inviting a small group of people who represent your target audience and discuss their perceptions and opinions about a product

-Quantitative
	Surveys/forms: questionnair that gathers a large volume fo repsonses
	Eye-tracking: Tehch to messure eye movements to know what the person is looking at and grabs their attention first
	Product analytics: tracking users clicks on an app
